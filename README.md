## Final Year Project: Data Service Sharing Scheme Based on Ethereum

Check [the documentation here](https://datatoken.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The project aimed to implement a ledger keeping scheme for paid Wi-Fi services hosted by individual mobil device owners who wish to share their data service via Wi-Fi hot spot.
Blockchain technology, specifically, digital currencies that live on blockchains provide decentralized solutions to book keeping.
This project was developed using Solidity, thus it was based on Ethereum.
